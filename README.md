# microbit

* The setup function initializes the MAX7219 matrices.
* The _registerAll function sends a command to all matrices.
* The clearAll function clears all LEDs on all matrices.
* The setup function is called with example parameters to demonstrate its usage.
* The for_4_in_1_modules function sets the rotation and reversed order for the 4-in-1 MAX7219 modules.
* The _registerAll function writes a command and data to all MAX7219 matrices.
* The _registerForOne function writes a command and data to a specific MAX7219 matrix by index.
* An example usage of for_4_in_1_modules is provided, assuming rotation_direction.none corresponds to 0.

You may need to adjust rotation values according to the specific enumeration or constants used in your application.
