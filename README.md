* The setup function initializes the MAX7219 matrices.
* The _registerAll function sends a command to all matrices.
* The clearAll function clears all LEDs on all matrices.
* The setup function is called with example parameters to demonstrate its usage.
* The for_4_in_1_modules function sets the rotation and reversed order for the 4-in-1 MAX7219 modules.
* The _registerAll function writes a command and data to all MAX7219 matrices.
* The _registerForOne function writes a command and data to a specific MAX7219 matrix by index.
* An example usage of for_4_in_1_modules is provided, assuming rotation_direction.none corresponds to 0.

You may need to adjust rotation values according to the specific enumeration or constants used in your application.

* The _rotateMatrix function rotates the given matrix according to the specified _rotation value.
* Different rotation directions are assumed to be represented by integers (1 for clockwise, 2 for counterclockwise, and 3 for 180 degrees), and you may need to adjust these according to your specific constants.
* An example usage of _rotateMatrix is provided, which initializes a matrix and applies a rotation based on _rotation.

* The _getMatrixFromColumns function converts a column array into an 8x8 matrix.
* The matrix is initialized as an 8x8 grid of zeros.
* The function iterates over each column and row, setting the matrix values based on the bit representation of the column values.
* An example usage of _getMatrixFromColumns is provided, which initializes a column array and converts it to a matrix.


* The scrollText function scrolls a text across all MAX7219 matrices.
* The function initializes necessary variables and arrays.
* It clears the screen and display array, calculates the font index for each character, and determines the total scroll time needed.
* It prints characters into the display array and scrolls the array, updating the display of each MAX7219 matrix as needed.
* The scrollText function is called with example parameters to demonstrate its usage.
* Example font and font_matrix are provided for illustration, and you should replace these with your actual font data.
